# Why?

OpenAI's official playground is currently missing features for saving/loading Chat Completions, and for testing the new Functions capability. I want a playground environment that I can keep up to date with my own needs.

I'm also using it as an excuse to learn SolidJS and try some dev tools I don't normally use like Prettier and Tailwind.

Sure, feel free! It would be cool if this turns into a community-driven project but I don't expect it will.
